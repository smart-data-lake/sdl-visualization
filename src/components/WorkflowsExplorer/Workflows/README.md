## About this component

The Workflows component is the parent component for the workflows page, which displays a table of workflows and allows the user to quickly see information about this workflow.

It uses the Toolbar component to filter, search and sort the data (those function can be provided to the component as props, see the README of "/src/components/WorkflowsExplorer/ToolBar").
