## About this component
The component Run is the top component of the run page. The run page displays all information about a particular attempt of a run. It includes the option to display a timeline, a table, and in future versions the lineage of the workflow.

This page enables to visually analyse a run and to quickly determine bottlenecks in perfomance.
